Vercel and other serverless platforms enforce strict execution timeout limits, often killing serverless functions after 10 to 15 seconds. This makes them unsuitable for running long-running AI generation tasks or multi-step logic compilation.

Our solution was to migrate our API backends to local PM2 edge nodes. Because we own the hardware, we can configure execution timeouts to be infinite, allowing Zayvora to run multi-minute reasoning loops without interruption.

We use Vercel exclusively to host static UI assets, routing all dynamic api requests to our local Mac Mini M4 via secure tunnels. This hybrid approach combines global CDN delivery with unlimited local compute.
