Once Layer 1 extracts variables and identifies the correct physics equation, Layer 2 executes the calculations. Instead of relying on a neural network to estimate the result, Zayvora spins up a deterministic Python sandbox utilizing SymPy for symbolic math and Pint for unit tracking.

Every variable is parsed along with its physical unit. The Pint library handles dimensional scaling, transforming inputs from inches, bars, or gallons to standard SI units like meters, Pascals, and cubic meters per second. SymPy then substitutes these values into the symbolic representation of the equation, solving for the unknown variable programmatically.

This approach guarantees absolute numeric precision. It behaves exactly like standard software engineering code, generating a verifiable trace of the formula used, step-by-step substitution, and dimensional calculations, leaving no room for probabilistic errors.
