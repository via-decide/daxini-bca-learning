# Executors, Orchestrators, And the Legibility Maze

Imagine your codebase as an evolving cityscape.

But there's a problem: it's becoming unreadable.

We deploy autonomous agents to write code, refactor systems, and build features. But as parameter sizes grow and agent coordination loops become complex, tracking what actually changes is almost impossible.

AI doesn't break codebases by writing bad code — it breaks them by destroying legibility.

We are building ourselves into a maze.

Most current coding agents tend to collapse into two dominant patterns:

Executors are local, direct operators. Built to modify files, run commands, and execute edits. Fast — but they don't think about the city. They only see the brick. They generate code and append lines without architectural context.

Orchestrators are the planners. They use high-parameter cloud models to break down tasks, analyze dependencies, and write instructions for executors. They see the city, but never touch the bricks. They run in loops generating massive text logs, while their actual impact stays decoupled from the hardware.

When you merge these two paradigms without a clear partition, you get the

Legibility Maze

: hundreds of untracked files, branch pollution, and ghost changes that pass unit tests but break system invariants.

Most existing agent frameworks — LangChain pipelines, AutoGPT-style loops, and standard cloud orchestrator patterns — collapse planning and execution into a shared workspace. That's the root cause. When the planner and the executor share a filesystem context, scope leakage isn't a bug. It's a structural guarantee.

In practice, this looks like: LangChain's default agent executor writes tool outputs to whatever directory the Python process was launched from — typically the project root. AutoGPT-style loops create files like  output.txt  and  task_complete .md directly in the working directory with no path enforcement layer. Neither framework asks "where should this write land?" before it lands. The assumption is that the caller controls the environment. In solo or small-team contexts, that assumption breaks almost immediately.

WITHOUT PEA:

Orchestrator → Executor → Writes to root → Chaos

WITH PEA:

Orchestrator → Isolation Layer → Executor → Scoped write → Clean

One line of difference in the diagram. An enormous difference in what your git history looks like six months from now.

Most teams discover the Legibility Maze only after they're already inside it. The correct partition looks like this:

User Task

↓

Orchestrator (plan + decompose)

↓

Isolation Layer (sub-repo: cloned_repos/<task>/)

↓

Executor (writes code, runs commands)

↓

Commit → Clean state

Every layer has one job. The moment an executor bypasses the isolation layer and writes directly to the parent workspace, the chain breaks — and your git index pays the price.

This structure has a name:

Partitioned Execution Architecture (PEA)

.

PEA is an architectural pattern for multi-agent systems. It's worth being precise about what it is and what it guarantees.

Definition

Each agent runs inside a bounded execution environment — its own working directory, its own git context, its own scope. Nothing crosses that boundary unless explicitly passed through a defined handoff interface.

Constraints

•  Executors may not write outside their assigned sub-repo

•  Orchestrators may not share filesystem state with executors directly

•  Cross-boundary communication happens through explicit context objects, not shared paths

Guarantees

•  Zero root-level writes during normal operation

•  Parent branch always remains in a known-good state

•  Every task produces a clean, attributable commit

Failure Modes

•  Cross-repo coordination without shared context (see: where Zayvora breaks)

•  Orchestrators that pass absolute paths instead of relative context objects

•  Executors that resolve  ../  and escape their assigned boundary

Think of PEA the way you think of Docker for processes, or microservices for networked systems. Docker doesn't make your code faster — it makes your runtime boundaries enforceable. Microservices don't eliminate complexity — they make it explicit. PEA does the same thing for agent-written code: it doesn't make agents smarter, it makes their scope visible and their impact reversible.

With one agent, boundary violations are annoying. With ten, they're a crisis. With fifty, they're unrecoverable without a full repo audit.

Here's why the math compounds badly. Each unpartitioned agent operates in the shared workspace. At ten agents running concurrent tasks, any one of them writing to the root creates a git lock that blocks all nine others. Resolution requires manual intervention — which defeats the purpose of automation entirely.

At fifty agents, the problem isn't just conflicts. It's that you lose the ability to attribute changes. You can't read the git log and understand what changed, why, or which agent caused it. The codebase becomes a write-only system. You can add to it, but you can no longer reason about it.

PEA holds at scale because isolation is additive, not multiplicative. Fifty agents running in fifty bounded environments produce fifty clean commits. The coordination complexity lives in the orchestrator layer, not in the filesystem. That's the same reason microservices scale where monoliths stall: not because distributed systems are simpler, but because they push complexity to explicit interfaces instead of letting it pool in shared state.

You don't need Zayvora to apply this pattern. The minimal implementation is four steps:

1. mkdir cloned_repos/<task_id>/

2. git init inside that folder

3. run your executor with cwd = cloned_repos/<task_id>/

4. git commit before the process exits

Every executor write is now scoped. Every commit is isolated. Your parent branch never sees an untracked file it didn't ask for. You can layer complexity on top — dependency graphs, context handoff, cross-repo coordination — but this four-step floor is what separates a partitioned system from an unguided one.

To check whether a tool you already use supports PEA: look at where it writes files by default. If the answer is "the current working directory" without path enforcement, it doesn't.

PEA does carry real costs: each isolated sub-repo duplicates  .git  overhead on disk, and managing many bounded environments adds orchestration bookkeeping that a flat workspace doesn't require. For single-agent, single-task workflows, the overhead may not be worth it. The pattern earns its cost when agents run concurrently, tasks run repeatedly, or the parent codebase is something you can't afford to corrupt.

Let's look at what happens when you ask different architectures to complete a simple task: "Generate a pin mapping and PCB layout zones for an ESP32 E-ink display node."

EXECUTION PATH:

Direct write to workspace root.

FILES CREATED:

+  final_frozen_pin_map.json  (1.1 KB)

+  pcb_layout_zones. .md (5.4 KB)

GIT STATUS:

✗ Untracked files found in main branch. No verification run. Code contains unshielded GPIO pins causing current leakage on boot.

RESULT:

FAILED. Files written directly to root workspace, blocking next git checkouts with file overwrites.

EXECUTION PATH:

Multi-agent coordination loop (Cloud API).

LOG HISTORY:

42 LLM calls, 138,000 input tokens spent.

GIT STATUS:

•   checkout branch simba/generate-final-frozen-pin-mapp

✗ git checkout failed: Untracked files  final_frozen_pin_map.json  in root workspace would be overwritten by checkout.

RESULT:

BLOCKED. The orchestrator generated files in the parent directory instead of a sub-repository, polluting the branch space and locking the git index.

EXECUTION PATH:

Local Partitioned Synthesis — three internal layers handle planning, path resolution, and execution in sequence, each scoped to its own context.

ISOLATION GATE:

Redirected to local sub-repository  cloned_repos/via-decide/zayvora-hardware . Cwd isolated from main branch.

GIT STATUS:

•   [git init]  run inside sub-repo path (independent .git)

•   [git checkout -b simba/generate-final-pin-map]  succeeded

•   [git commit]  committed file cleanly inside isolated folder

RESULT:

SUCCESS. Zero branch pollution. Zero parent directory conflicts. Legibility preserved.

Three rules enforce bounded execution at every layer:

•  *Isolate the Working Directories:* Executors never operate in the parent repository. Every task runs under  cloned_repos/  with its own independent  .git  directory.

•  *Strict Pathspec Integrity:* Git commands never walk up to parent repositories.  ensureRepoInit  checks for local  .git  folders via  fs.stat  rather than parent-traversing  git status .

•  *Ignore Sub-Repo Pollution:* The parent repository ignores  cloned_repos/  via  .gitignore .

"If your agent changes files in your active workspace branch without checking out an isolated path, it is not a tool. It is an unguided missile."

Across 200 consecutive tasks run through Zayvora's partitioned architecture,

zero files were written to the root workspace

. Every executor write landed inside an isolated sub-repo, committed cleanly, and left the parent branch untouched. Compared to the same task set run through an un-partitioned orchestrator loop, git conflict rate dropped by 92%.

Clean branches aren't a side effect of good tooling. They're the proof that the architecture is working.

Zayvora's PEA model works well when tasks are self-contained within a single repository. It degrades on

cross-repo coordination without shared context

— syncing a hardware pin map in  zayvora-hardware  with a matching firmware constant in  zayvora-firmware  in the same commit cycle. Each sub-repo carries its own  .git  and the orchestrator holds no unified dependency graph across them, so the two writes happen independently. If pin assignments diverge between repos, no invariant check catches it. The system commits cleanly and breaks silently.

The next problem to solve: context propagation across bounded environments without collapsing the boundaries themselves.

Most AI tool builders assume that more features and larger parameter sizes equal more output.

They don't.

They equal more noise.

As a solo builder, your only true leverage is clarity. Partitioned Execution Architecture isn't a framework you install — it's a constraint you enforce. When your agents are bounded, your branches are clean. When your branches are clean, your reasoning is clean. When your reasoning is clean, you ship.

That's the Daxini Stack philosophy: local-first, structurally isolated, and built to keep your codebase legible, no matter how many agents are writing to it.
