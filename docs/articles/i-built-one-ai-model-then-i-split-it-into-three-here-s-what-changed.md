Six weeks ago, I shipped Zayvora — a local reasoning engine for engineers who think in systems.

One model. One purpose. One command:

\

Zayvora's core is a 6-stage reasoning loop:

\

I didn't retrain anything. I didn't add parameters. I didn't increase the model size by a single byte.

I split the system prompt into three distinct operational modes — each one built for a different kind of thinking:

Zayvora:Axiom

— for decisions under uncertainty.

When you need to reason slowly, not confidently. When the wrong answer is worse than no answer.

Zayvora:Praxis

— for builders who need to ship.

WHAT → WHY → HOW → WATCH OUT. Four lines. Then you move.

Zayvora:Nexar

— for research and synthesis.

SIGNAL → EVIDENCE → GAPS → VECTOR. Surface what's true, not what sounds true.

I asked all three the same thing:

> "Should I use BM25 or dense embeddings for my RAG system?"

Axiom

decomposed it into five sub-problems, flagged three assumptions I hadn't stated, worked through the math, and delivered a reasoned recommendation with caveats.

Praxis

said: use BM25 first. It's faster to debug. Add dense when you know your failure modes. Here's how to set it up in 4 steps. Watch out for stale indexes.

Nexar

surfaced what the literature actually says about hybrid retrieval, what BM25 misses at semantic scale, where the evidence is thin, and what question I should ask next.

Three different tools. Same 6-stage reasoning core underneath.

Most people think model quality = parameter count.

It doesn't.

A 4.7GB model with the right operational frame outperforms a 70B model with the wrong one. Every time.

The system prompt is the architecture. The model is the hardware.

Zayvora:Praxis doesn't know more than Zayvora:Axiom. It just knows what kind of output you need, and it stops before it over-builds.

That's the entire insight.

₹0.

No retraining. No fine-tuning. No GPU time. No cloud bill.

I spent time — which is the only thing I have to spend as a solo builder — thinking clearly about what each mode of reasoning actually requires.

Three Modelfiles. Three system prompts. One bash script to build them all.

That's the whole engineering delta.

\

One model family. Purpose-built modes. Zero framework debt.

Not every problem needs a new model.

Most problems need a clearer frame.

Zayvora:Axiom, Praxis, and Nexar are the same engine — running in the mode the problem actually requires.

That's the Daxini Stack philosophy: local-first, sovereign, and built for solo builders who don't have time for tools that think for themselves.
